## Overall Learning 

This capstone project provided comprehensive hands-on experience in applying data analytics concepts to a real-world business problem. It strengthened my ability to work with raw, unstructured data and transform it into meaningful insights through systematic cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

I gained practical exposure to using Excel for data preparation, SQL for structured querying and aggregation, Python for exploratory analysis and basic predictive modeling, and Power BI for interactive dashboard creation. The project improved my understanding of how different tools integrate within an end-to-end analytics pipeline.

Additionally, the project enhanced my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and data-driven decision-making ability. It also improved my capability to present insights clearly and professionally for business stakeholders, making the learning outcome both technically and practically valuable.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: <Pizza Analysis Report></h3>
<p>
This project involved a comprehensive Data Science analysis of a pizza sales dataset, comprising 48,620 transactions. The primary goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence using SQL for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Python for advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modelling.
Key insights derived include: identification of peak sales periods (hourly and daily), top-performing product categories (driving revenue), and optimal pizza sizes. Two predictive models were developed: a Linear Regression model for highly accurate profit forecasting and a Logistic Regression model for classifying high-value 'large orders'. The models achieved near-perfect accuracy, validating the feature engineering and providing deployable assets for the business intelligence dashboard (Power BI). The findings offer clear recommendations for optimizing staffing, pricing strategy, and inventory management.
