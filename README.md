## Overall Learning 

This capstone project provided comprehensive hands-on experience in applying data analytics concepts to a real-world business problem. It strengthened my ability to work with raw, unstructured data and transform it into meaningful insights through systematic cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

I gained practical exposure to using Excel for data preparation, SQL for structured querying and aggregation, Python for exploratory analysis and basic predictive modeling, and Power BI for interactive dashboard creation. The project improved my understanding of how different tools integrate within an end-to-end analytics pipeline.

Additionally, the project enhanced my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and data-driven decision-making ability. It also improved my capability to present insights clearly and professionally for business stakeholders, making the learning outcome both technically and practically valuable.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: <Pizza Analysis Report></h3>
<p>
This project involved a comprehensive Data Science analysis of a pizza sales dataset, comprising 48,620 transactions. The primary goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence using SQL for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Python for advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modelling.
Key insights derived include: identification of peak sales periods (hourly and daily), top-performing product categories (driving revenue), and optimal pizza sizes. Two predictive models were developed: a Linear Regression model for highly accurate profit forecasting and a Logistic Regression model for classifying high-value 'large orders'. The models achieved near-perfect accuracy, validating the feature engineering and providing deployable assets for the business intelligence dashboard (Power BI). The findings offer clear recommendations for optimizing staffing, pricing strategy, and inventory management.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->

The Life Skills Training (LST) and Soft Skills Training (SST) sessions significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth during the internship. These sessions emphasized the importance of leadership qualities, self-discipline, time management, and maintaining a positive attitude in both academic and professional environments. I learned how discipline and consistency play a crucial role in achieving long-term goals.

The training sessions helped me strengthen my communication skills, including effective verbal communication, active listening, and appropriate body language. I gained a clear understanding of how to present ideas confidently and professionally through structured presentations and discussions. The SST sessions also focused on interview skills such as resume explanation, answering technical and HR questions, and handling interview situations with confidence.

Additionally, the sessions highlighted the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and professional ethics in the workplace. Overall, LST and SST sessions improved my confidence, professionalism, leadership mindset, and readiness to face real-world corporate and industry challenges.

## **Community Services**

<!-- add descreption in your own words -->

During my internship period, I actively participated in several community service activities that focused on social welfare, environmental sustainability, and support for underprivileged individuals. These initiatives helped me gain a deeper understanding of social responsibility and the role individuals play in contributing to community development.

Through active involvement in these activities, I learned the importance of empathy, compassion, and collective effort in addressing social challenges. Engaging directly with people in need made me more aware of real-life issues faced by underprivileged communities and motivated me to contribute beyond academic and technical responsibilities. These experiences strengthened my sense of civic duty, encouraged ethical behavior, and helped me develop a balanced perspective between professional growth and social contribution. .....<!-- add descreption in your own words -->
